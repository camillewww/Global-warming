# Forecasting on global warming in the future 10 years
This is a project that I wrote when I was an undergrad student. 

Is it true that the whole world is experiencing a significant increase of global temperature? If so, how fast is the temperature growing? Should we be worried about global warming in 10 years? In this project, my goal is to solve these questions by studying a time series measuring the evolution of global temperature, while trying to fit in a model in order to give a prediction on the land-air temperature for the next ten years using R.
